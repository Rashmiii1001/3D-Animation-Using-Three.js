In this project, there are blocks representing elements from periodic table. When you click on any box (element), that particular element's electronic configuration in orbitals is displayed. Also, basic info (like symbol, atomic no, etc) related to that element is also shown. If you click anywhere on the screen the orbitals and info will disappear.
